Overview
In a text-based adventure game, the user is presented a scenario with different options. Depending on the option they choose, they have different consequences, which in turn present different choices for the next action.

Consider the following example:

You are walking through a dark forest and find two items: a MATCH and a FLASHLIGHT. Which one do you want to pick up?

The user can then type "match" or "flashlight".

If the user types "match" they may see a response such as:

You pick up the match and strike it, and for an instant, the forest around you is illuminated. You see a large grizzly bear, and then the match burns out. Do you want to RUN, or HIDE behind a tree?

Whereas, if the user typed "flashlight" in response to the original question, they may see a response such as:

You pick up the flashlight and turn it on. You see the pathway lit up in front of you, but you thought you also heard something off to the side. Do you want to FOLLOW the path or LOOK in the trees for the thing that made the noise?

Your choice at each step of the game determines what you see next and the options you have available at that point.
